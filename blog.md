# Epicodus day one!

My first day of learning to program with Epicodus is going great!  I am really enjoying working through the initial lessons.

So far we have covered:
* Git project setup.
* Tracking changes with Git.
* Github remote repositories.

And now we are tackling markdown!

*I enjoy coming back to these excerpts about the growth mindset when feeling stuck.*
>Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows.

>Neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones.

>Our intelligence is not fixed, and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might struggle and fail.

>People with growth mindsets correctly believe that capability and intelligence can be grown through effort, struggle and failure.

>Mindsets can be taught; theyâ€™re malleable.

>Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows.

Looking forward to learning more!
